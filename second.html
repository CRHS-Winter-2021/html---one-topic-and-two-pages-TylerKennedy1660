		The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)[4] is a domesticated form of wolf. The dog descended from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers more than 15,000 years ago,[6] prior to the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[9] enabling an abundant cosmopolitan distribution[10] and to be able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]

		The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities and physical attributes.[12] Dogs are subclassified into breeds, which vary widely in shape, size and color.[13] They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."<br>

		In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[14][15] and under this genus he listed the domestic dog, gray wolf and the golden jackal. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris, and on the next page he classified the gray wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other canid.[16]

		In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from the gray wolf, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other.[17] In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris Linneaus 1758 and dingo Meyer 1793. Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the "domestic dog" clade,[18] and they debate this classification.[19]

		In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral dogs Canis familiaris and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.[20]

		Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans.[98] For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.[105][106] Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.[105][107]

		Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together.[108] One study reported that in Wisconsin, in 1999, more compensation had been paid for losses due to wolves taking dogs than for wolves taking livestock. In Wisconsin, wolves will often kill hunting dogs, possibly because they are in the wolves' territory.[108] A strategy has been reported in Russia where one wolf lures a dog into a heavy brush where another wolf waits in ambush.[109] In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.[110] Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.[105]

		Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size.[111] Tigers in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia are also reported to kill dogs.[112] Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in Turkmenistan, India and the Caucasus.[113]
